Minot board 300 just had the Rmv Jobs flag changed from N to Y as of Jan 1. To properly position the turn back on the board we need a Markup rotation method - none was defined for this board. Without the rotation method the program was creating a turn rotation key based on activity time (the default for markups) rather than using the blueprint logic to build the key. I manually adjusted the rotation key of the turn in error by using ZAP 7. As follow-up I created a list of all boards using blueprint rotation methods and had crew management enter blueprint markup rotations regardless if the Rmv Jobs fields was Y or N.

This was a good one - as it turns out Crew Management did not modify any data and no program changes caused the edit. Yard group 03 had been successfully called for the prior week+, there were no program changes so we need to concentrate on the data. The edit is checking that the jobs on the yard group can validly go to the away destination on the crew route. The valid destinations for a job are defined in CCJOB - there are 4 'Destination Stations' fields - but the home terminal of the job doesn't need to be included - by default a job can always be destined to its own crew station. Yard jobs never leave their own home terminal - by design all yard jobs are called and tie-up at the home terminal station of the job -- as a result the above edit should never come up in CCYARD because all jobs are valid to their own home terminal. So we need to look elsewhere. Looking at CCTO the turn and employee were not rested for the 1800 on duty time: ********  01 1800 HTN301U 18 RL MCALPINE T2230 E2230 1430 0800 0210 1430  1800 HTN301U 25 POS T2230 1430 0210 1430  ******** The crew route HTNYARD had the turn rest fields set to \"Y\" (T/R on the far right of the screen). The turn rest indicator causes the calling process to automatically reject any turns that will not be rested at the scheduled on duty time. As a result turn HTN301U was rejected -- since we're dealing with scheduled turns there is no replacement turn, CCYARD did not pick up any turns (this was the only scheduled turn for this yard group). And stumbled into this process - with a blank job it tried to compare that against the HOUSTX destintation and caused the edit to display. The crew route has probably been setup this way since it was created -- you wouldn't have a problem unless the turn was not rested. The turn HTN301U was not rested because -- the turn did not complete tie-up from 2/9 until 2/10 1430 - putting the yard turn on duty for almoat 20+ hours ( I don't think so!) That’s what really caused this problem to surface.",

To get around the problem temporarily, we just manually typed the employee's name in that would have been awared the job. This is a work around. However, we will need to make a program change to get this array size in sync. I am guessing that we reduced the size of the array to 200 in MVENJBAS because program space is limited and this program has blown before because other arrays in the program were defined too small. In order to bump the size of other arrays, this OSL array was reduced, but the subprogram array size was not reduced. Also note that 2 other programs use MVENOSLR. They are MVENJBLH and MVENJBBL, both of which are involved in the same assigning processing.

At 19:40 go another page, ingnored because my supper was on the grill. At 20:10 after finished my Salmon fillet and Garlic shrimp, decided better go in and check on VRU's. When I arrived the VRU 2 was at the NT signon screen, with a message that had been shut down due to low memory. I logged into VRU and when console screen came up the error log was writing that unable to connect to host. This happens when VRU loose their host sessions. The log had been writing out for several hours and had accumulated 2.5 gig in 1 file 1.2 gig in the $$UDI file and another 1.8 gig in a %%EICON file. Solution is to go into the TALXWARE icon on the screen. Bring up SERVER Easy Set. Then expand on the Server Parameter tree. Go down to Host link and double click. Then enter password of \"EMPTY\" and will bring up pop up box. Right click on the 'BNSF' client and select Stop. This will stop the host link so the log will stop writing, Then go down to the 3270/5250 Host configuration box and expand it. Then select Eicon Session Manager branch and double click. This will bring up another pop up window. On the left pane of the window, titled \"Configured Settings\" delete the host client titled \"3270-NAME\" by right clicking on the client and selete \"delete configured setting\" a pop up window warns you, select OK, then save this setting without a configured client. After saving drap the client from the right pane titled \"Configured Destinations\" back over to the the \"Configured Settings\" window and save this. After doing this, close the window and start back up the host link, by right clicking on 'BNSF' client and then you error log should start indicating that port 1 connected to host, port 2 connected to host and so on.

It can process engineers only or conductor/fireman. In order to process all three occupations it has to pass through the program twice. If the value in the CREW_DAY field is 302 for all crafts, the first time through, when it is processing conductors/fireman the program will process the 3's = conductors and the 2's = fireman. The second time through it is looking for engineers but it finds the value 302 on the 01 craft and attempts to process the conductors and fireman again but there are already values there so gives a duplication error. f there is a 10 in the crew day for engineers it sees the 1's = engineers and processes through.",

This lets Natural know that we are (true) non message driven. 4. change refer-back in ABEND step to NATBMPN (step name within proc), eg. COND=(0,EQ,STEP030.NATBMPN).

I looked at the programs affected and didn't see anything that had moved in the past 3 months. I watched the board and waited until he had them sorted then called Ed back. He said he had sorted the best he could tell. I told him I would talk to Su on Monday to see if there was any reason she could think of that this is happening. I hung up the phone and ten minutes later Ed pages me saying the working board was fine but the Active board was still messed up. At this point he told me he had only been on this desk a couple of weeks. He said he had talked to Sam, another caller who had worked as chief on this desk before and the reason it was re-ordering the board was because it was activating rested turns and running around non-rested turns. So if an employee ties up for 14 hours rest and is not rested at activation time it pulls up the next rested employee and renumbers the pool.

Since CCPLAN1 was not abending, I surmised there was a change in a runthru, board, or route, and asked that Dan Stout be called. A bridge was set up, and when Dan Stout called in he explained to Richard that he would not see the other trains and crews until the data had cycled. He gave him a work around. Explanation provided by Dan Stout later in the morning: The problem with CCPLAN1 was that they changed agreements from a 10 and 5 board to a first in first out board. To handle this, instead of modifying board 42 (the old home terminal board at FtMadeast) they created a new board 40. So all employees that were at the home terminal were moved to board 40 from 42. The problem is that there are still employees working on board 42 and cannot be moved until they return to the home terminal. CCPLAN1 looks at the home terminal board only when putting the turns in order for the display. So since we now have employees working off both boards, 40 and 42, we have to wait for the crews to rotate through a cycle to get them all on board 40. Once that is done, CCPLAN1 will work fine for the conductors. Until then, the planner can use CCPLAN1 for the engineers which will basically give them the same information",

After IVR1 was back up, I checked to make sure everything was now working okay, and instead now all calls were going into call/s not started status. Asked Michelle from sit desk to get someone from MQ on the bridge. She called someone from IBM operations to pass on this request. 10 minutes later... MQ first-out (Joey) was called.

Reggie and Julie were paged, and I asked to have someone, anyone from MQ paged to join the bridge. 10 minutes later Julie came on and escalated the problem further. Crew office rated the severity of the problem a 7 out of 10. Finally, Chip, from MQ, joined the bridge after their 2nd out also failed to respond. He could not see any problems with the queues. At some point, Reggie, Stephanie, and Larry Kasper joined the bridge as well. At 130, after exhausting all our ideas, we decided to try rebooting both IVRs, and somehow this seemed to fix the problem. Calls were working on both IVRs.

Told him AOC looked okay, would look into it more in the morning. Don and Reggie both looked at and it appeared the job had been messed with. Don's remarks: A likely suspect is job KCK2613 01 -- not sure how it ended up 1st out on active board KANCKS 32, vacant and in OT status. Looks like it got activated by mistake earlier in the day when the crew office was messing the around with the assignment for this job. Reggie's remarks: In addition to that, at the same time as below, job KCK2613 01 was showing as being removed from the HT board KANCKS 24. This job appears to have been all screwed up. I agree with Don that this job is most likely the cause of the problem. 2. Was unable to find the tasks on the task list which he was talking about. Dean thought the clerks were executing them manually. The crew for XINBURH314A had been deadheaded on an I symbol t the train, and the comments on XINBURH314A had been modified to show the crews name, SHORT/ANDERSON. They were waiting on the crew to execute XINBURH314A. I told him if the task for XINBURH314A was executed the problem would probably go away. He executed the task and there were no more pages.

This train autocall info showed it was started at 08:37 then cancelled later. The train was eventually manually outbound. We suspect this train may have been the culprit. Interesting notes on the AOC history CCACBRO. There were 2 KCE crews with auto call informaton and 1 GAL conductor with AOC information. Looks like auto call started then cancelled another conductor put on turn then auto call restarted. This is when natural errors began occuring. Can only track the error time on these account they are run non coversational. The non - conversational tranactions were running under tranaction NATNAOMQ. We had Harvey look, and couldn't find any issues. Reggie was looking at issues, couldn't find anything. It appearred intermittand calls were going throught, but still getting calls not started messages on some trains. Finally I began running /dis tran NATNAOMQ to get the tranactions status for each production P1 P2, & P3, When I got to P3 discovered the tranaction was stopped. Now initally our transactions were set up so they would not stop when errors occurred, but a changes had been put into place the previous week that would stop the tran when certain errors were encountered. I restarted the tran using \"/sta tran NATNAOMQ\" command. This started the tranaction and calls began going through normally. See attached text from message Jon sent out after talking with Rick Poirer about the tran stopping: EMAIL TEXT FROM JON------------------- With the new changes that Rick Poirer put in about a week ago, 10 nat954 errors in 10 minutes will stop a tran. That is the only error he captures right now that will stop a tran (that’s why the 844 1143 errors did not stop the tran the 2nd time. We spoke with poirer for just a bit and he said he has complete control as to what errors stop what trans and after how many occurrences. He can set us up so that we no longer stop trans on the 954 for our crew trans, or we may want to work with him to do some customization to help us get better alerts. Jon",

CS nees to contact their dispatcher and tell the dispatche to let them know when they want to call a train. I called MFOPS and talked to Archie. I asked what OTCRWTL1 was and he told me it was an IMS transaction which had gone down and was causing -181 errors in Production. Checked the error log and found several -181 errors in the board sort program. Told him I would have to look at this. Began researching -181 errors. At 01:27 and 01:36 received automated MQ Send Failed pages. Checked log and found there were about 50 errors. Called MFOPS to open a bridge. While talking to Archie about this - received a page from Reao to join a conference bridge. Joined the bridge regarding IMS transactions being down. They asked if I knew anything about the -803 errors we were getting in Production. I said no I had been looking at -181's. Also mentioned that we were getting MW Send Failed errors. About that time Julie got on the bridge and we had the MQ person paged. Looked at the error log for -803 errors and found that we were getting multiple errors on DECNVRFY, DECNFILL and CRWNLOCK. The biggest number of errors were coming from CRWNLOCK - this was part of train call and was being called from a Cobalt program. The impact was that when the dispatcher finaled the train it did not update on the task list. Therefore the Crew Tech did not know when to call the train. Once we realized what was going on and CS notified the field to contact them when ordering a train (phone, CAD messaging) everything went pretty smooth. Once they got the call they just had to kick off the automated process. Julie had Reggie paged to the bridge to look at the train call programs. Don Boden & Patrick Sbrocca from Service Scheduling were also on the bridge. It was detemined that the problem was due to how GENATMSP was handling the Leap Year issue. During the course of the morning Patrick made several EME moves to try to correct the problem in the Cobalt program but were still getting errors. Larry McCammon finally determined that he had made a performance enhancement to GENATMSP back in 2002 which was the culprit. He moved the pre-2002 program to production and the errors stopped.",

Apparently the crew day field will show 102 for enginer 302 for conductors etc…. Well for some reason the engineer crew day on the WANOKA sub was showing a 302 instead of 102. This is a crew day for conductors, therefore a duplicate record existed. Using Zap 25 updated the field to show 102 instead of 302. THANKS go to Hurla and Tom for helping me solve issue. Batch job ran successfully.",

Pages continued through outage. Monitored via IMS. IMS showed VRU3, and VRU4 did not have all of the sessions, but had at least 8 sessions. While handling the AOC problems, Situation desk told me there was a server problem which affected the VRU's gave me a bridge number. Called the bridge and found it was for the IVR problem. AOC problem had stopped by then. Went back to VRU issue. Again tried to connect via PC Anywhere but could only connect to VRU4. Tried to contact Brian or Ryan. No luck. Put in call to TALX. TALX on call support, Patrick called. TALX said we must have a network problem to connect thru the modem. Disconnected my mainframe session and dialed in on each modem. All VRU'S were up and running but VRU3 and VRU 4 did not have all sessions. Regular reset period was ready to start. Waited out the resetting period, but still getting pages. Monitored in IMS and via PC Anywhere using modems. All VRU's were functioning. In the mean time got page on a SS#, and I called Jon to see if the 120+ table change could wait till Monday, and asked him about the problem -- wanted to know if I needed to drive and do a physical boot. Jon later called back and said he was in the area and could stop and check. Jon checked and called back and said all VRUs were functioning normally. Got another page. IMS showed VRU 4 was down. Dialed in using modem and sent CTL-ALT-DEL to VRU4. Panicked when I could not connect. Jon said wait a few minutes and try again. Checked all VRUs again and all were functioning fully. Still getting pages. Called situation desk, asked if the Network had been rolled, and had the alerts been pointed back to production. They assured me everything was fine and the alerts were pointing to production. Asked them to contact Larry McCammon to check on them. Still getting alerts. Paged Larry Mc Cammon myself. Alerts finally stopped. Talked with Larry McCammon on Monday. He called in after he got my page, and had operations re-run what they said they had already run. Message from Phil Carosone regarding VRU alerts Julie, the commands the operators issue when rolling Network from D to B are, on B - AO STOPALERTS on D - AO STARTALERTS The reverse is when going back from B to D. The change record indicated that issuing a AO STARTALERTS on the D was NOT necessary when IPL'ing the D. This is wrong, they should be issuing the cmd AO STARTALERTS after the IPL of the D. I've corrected the change records that Rick Cauthon uses to create the upcoming Network Rolls instructing the Operators to issue the start cmd.",

We called Kim Robardey who said the following: When job ZCCRWHIS went down and Dennis had it force completed and a new job demanded in it created two ZCCRWHIS jobs running at the same time because the system automatically demands in a new job when ZCCRWHIS is force completed. We were getting the errors because these two jobs run back to back. But, when the first job completed it would trigger the OTCRWHIS* jobs. But, they would go out and see that the second ZCCRWHIS was still running and abend. However, in some cases the ZCC* job would complete before the OTCRW* jobs.

JCL needs to be changed to move the RWABEND step immediately following the refer back step so that the job abends immediately after the step with the problem. Then the data can be fixed and the job restarted in the abending step, instead of from the top.",

Attempted to create 2 new jobs (C106 and C107) using CCJOB but failed because sequentially the program wanted 0094. And to make matters worse both 0092 and 0093 had just been outbound from the AFHT. And to make matters worse, worse job number is part of the key for all the tables requiring updating. To Correct: 1. Used Zap 7, OT-TJOB_BRD and added a record ALN C106 for both the HT and AFHT boards by displaying and copying a job from the board which was at the AFHT. 2. Used Zap 8, OT-TJOB_DEST and added destination records for the ALN C106 by displaying and copying a job already on the board. 3. Used Zap 9, OT-TJOBS and added a record for ALN C106 by displaying and copying a job already on the board (PS will be required to put in an INBD TMSTP value that I dummied up AND if this is a bogus job be sure to set the Bogus Flg to Y). 4. Used Zap 11, OT-TJOCC_WRK and added records for occupation code 03 by displaying and copying a job already on the board. 5. Now that the job is created and at the AFHT.

Finally, at 20:12 got another page from TSOC saying that the Crew Office was having troulbe with CCEMP for DC Jones. They were getting a Natural Error on CRWNBRDC at line 690. Checked DC Jones in ZAP 7 - OT-TJOB_BRD and found he had two records. Purged the AFHT record out and everything was good. ********************************************************************************************************************************** Below is the analysis Ryan did the following day: Auto Notify stopped last night because it could not process DC Jones' layoff schedule. When the system tried to lay him off LXX (not notified), there was an error in CRWNBRDC line 690 because of a record having a blank board number. There is no useful data in the spooler because the error did not result from the system trying to process an MQ message that was being returned from the IVR. That would have locked up NATNNOTR, not NATNNOTL. It resulted from the triggered program PANPINIT unsuccessfully trying to process a layoff schedule in OT-TEMPL_PHON_SCHED. We could have figured out which schedule was causing the problem by looking in OT-TEMPL_PHON_SCHED for the layoff schedule with the earliest CYCL_SCHD_STRT time, if we had known it was failing on a layoff. If this happens again, we now know to look for the earliest layoff schedule (TEL_CALL_STAT = 'L'), and the employee id will tell us what job number is bad. We could also add an ON ERROR routine to PANPINIT to prevent a bad record from stopping auto notify in the future. But it may not be worth it, since this is the first problem we've had in years.",

Employee G W Ewing had changed his three day vacation deleting the middle day. The automated layoff process must then split the existing layoff task and update the markup times.

The outlying forecasting job had picked up this task and was trying to determine if there was a back to back layoff. It uses the markup date and time, because the markup time was prior to the layoff time the logic in the forecasting job kept reading the same task over and over again. Two fixes need to be made 1- the forecasting job will be modified to recognize the bad mark up time and escape from the back to back logic and a time parameter will be added to the Job card so if a loop occurs the job will abend. 2.

I have summarized what I have learned, so that if this occurs again, and you are on call you will have a better idea of how to handle it than I did. TCPNENGS is called out of train call when it is sending 830 board call sheets to a printer or fax machine. A bad timestamp was being passed to TCPNENGS and it was abending on a Select statement to OT.TOTBD_EVT. Program CTPN830 calls STDN0268, SFESYS, which submits a request to execute TCPPP830 through NATBMP02. The call is dynamic so XREFPROG does not show the calling program for TCPPP830 ( I had to use scan to find it). When NATBMP02 encountered the error it was abending, also. NATBMP02 executes similar to a batch job executing over and over again. Job ZC1PNB02, in JHS, class O, will show the error and give a clue as to the train causing the problem. NATBMP02 is a shared transaction and is used throughout the system. When NATBMP02 went down, the queue kept filling. The operator tried several times to restart and it would go back down again. Jon and I (Jon was helping me -- Thanks Jon!) felt the top message on the queue was bad -- all trains were being successfully outbound, just the call sheets were missing. Jon asked the operator to delete the first record on the queue and restart the tran. The operator, mistakenly, told Jon the first record could not be removed, that only the entire queue could be cleared. Seeing the queue building and not being given any other option, we made the decision to clean the queue of approximately 1200 records ---- WRONG! WRONG! The operator was mistaken and the top record could have been removed. The lesson is if you have trouble with NATBMP02 and the operator does know how to remove a record, call for IMS support. Also, we have now learned that the bad record is discarded each time, and had the operator just kept starting the tran when it went down, we would have been okay. It seems train call has been sending these bad records, which seem to be related to the yard calling process, but there is a procedure that automatically restarts the tran when it has been down for 90 seconds, but this process was not working last night.",

So, we watched the next train that was scheduled to auto execute. Sure enough, another HT crew was called. So, I manually 'E'xecuted a few trains on the WINE and WIBE routes, and HT crews were presented every time. I investigated this issue for about 2 hours and could not find the problem. I did notice that there were a few AFHT jobs that were several times out LOCKed to future designated dhs. At this point, I told Dana that he should turn auto execute off on those boards and we would look into it more in the morning. He changed the auto call code to N on each of the boards. I instucted him to change the code to Y to allow AOC to handle the calls. Here is what I found the next day at the office: The problem was caused by having AFHT turns that were several times out LOCKed to future designated DHs. The initial job loading process was incorrectly assuming that the LOCKed AFHT turns were the first out AFHT turns and consequently bypassing the actual first out AFHT turns. Modifications have been made to select the first unLOCKed AFHT turn when the jobs are initially loaded in these situations. The fix was implemented to Prod at 17:08. This fix should prevent the issues that occurred last night. Auto execute can be turned on again for the Winslow/Needles active boards. There is no longer a need for the workaround processing. Crew planners and specialists can proceed with normal procedures for the Winslow/Needles and Winslow/Belen pools.",

Train was outbounded without an engineer. Will need to know what happened\" There was no return call number so I called the crew office. I don't recall who I spoke with, but I asked if there was any urgency in needing the answer or if they needed an answer by any specific time.

They requested information about the train, so we will need to find out something today. 11:40 Got another page from TSOC that said they were getting more problems with the outbound like before.

Kicked off autocall 5. engineer did not accept his call 6. computer picked up with autocanvassing at that point. 7. computer called a few employees all rejecting work. 8. fill rules were exhausted and task went into exception 9. Crew tech executed train and entered call screen. 10. Log shows train was outbounded 1 minute after the crew tech entered the screen. I spoke with the crew tech (Jackson?). He was not very forthcoming with info, but did not remember anything about what he had done the last time he executed the Z train. At this point I didn't think I was going to come to any conclusions without digging into the traincall code.

So I had to activate again the turns not showing again at 2258 but it totally dropped the WIN DH's but activated NEE6135 and NEE6158 on CCPLAN2 and CCTO board 42. So I deactivated what did show of the inaccurate 2259 failed activation and reactivated going back to the 2258 activation which was to complete the order of the original 2253 activation. The NEE6135 and NEE6158 had incorrectly showed activated on CCPLAN2 and CCTO Board 42 while nothing else activated.

Copy is email instruction sent by Don. Gaurav/Reggie, There's been some confusion over the Spokane/Hauser stuff since we turned it on - most of it just the new process for that location. But there are a couple of problems that need to be addressed, if we can: 1. If a train is manually 'E'xecuted prior to task time and the PF7 is hit on the call screen, nothing happens. The PF7 label just changes from Phon to Unph. If PHON call action is manually typed, we get edit that Employee is being called early. We need that same edit when the PF7 key is pressed. 2. We are getting weird task times after the train is ordered and it must be coming from service scheduling updates we're getting for the train after it's ordered. The Ordr time is not changing, just the task time. An example would be train X KALGFD1 16A at Hauyard on 12/17. When I looked at the task list, the Ordr time was 0915 and the task time was 0953. When I look at OT-TTASK_LIST_LOG, I see the 0915 order record coming in at 0901CT and a 1153 plan coming in at 0947. I manually changed the task time back to the correct 0800 with Zap 51. I've seen this a few other times as well. We can't have these task times affected like this. I am off on Monday but am available for anything with a page or a call to my cell phone: 817-917-0995 I will be in the office Tues. - Thurs. next week.",

Both engineers claimed their room phone had never rang. Looking at CCACBRO, both showed the error Invalid RACF Pswd. Crew office claimed neither train task had turned pink, so Crew did not know there was a problem. Trains were delayed about 45 minutes. Scanned Natural libraries, OT-CRW, SFESYS, OT-TLX and could not find where the error was coming from. Was at my sister's house so gave up until I could get home. Once home called Reggie again. Reggie explained that if the auto call had been restarted the CRW_TASK_SEQ is reset and the task does not show pink. He said the error message was coming from the IVR and is in OT.TCRW_MGMT_CDS. Looked at OT.TCRW_MGMT_CD and found message. Looked at CCACBRO and found that AOC for train CBTMPAM002A , FTSCOT, had been stopped and restarted. The Invalid RACF Pswd was received on the second call start. Looking at OT.TTASK_LIST in file manager found CRW_TASK_SEQ was 0. The second train, QMEMLAC107A, SPRIMO, showed 66 minutes passed between the Invalid RACF Pswd message and a VRU Call Rejected. The OT.TTASK_LIST record showed CRW_TASK_SEQ = -2, with comment = Call Rejected. Forwarded to Reggie and Guarav to look at to determine if this is a programming issue. =============================================================================== Follow up from Reggie -- The problem here is that the IVR is not sending the subsequent Call Transferred message to update the mainframe although the calls appear to have been transferred looking at CCVRUBRO. The processing should work as follows for an Invalid RACF response: 1) IVR sends the Invalid RACF response to the mainframe 2) IVR transfers the call to the crew office 3) IVR sends the Call Transferred response to the mainframe 4) The task record is updated with the Call Transferred exception. For the two cases below, only steps 1 & 2 occurred. From looking at our history records, this problem appears to have started when we switched over to the new IVR's. I checked the records for a few Invalid RACF response before 10/06, and they all were processed as described above. For all of the ones that I checked for 10/06 and afterwards, only steps 1 & 2 were performed. The main difference being that before 10/06, we were using TOPIVRP1 & TOPIVRP2, and afterwards we have been using TOPIVRP5, TOPIVRP6, TOPIVRP7 & TOPIVRP8.",

There are situations where they are required to allow more than the 1 floating week rule. Ex 1 Craft transfers or exempt to scheduled employees that have taken an more than 1 floating week of vacation. Ex 2 Employees used in Special Projects are allowed to float all vacations.

When asked if we can fix CREW 7, he said that it should be looked at when Reggie starts the Crew Planning project, so it won't be worth fixing at this time.

As the user was not available had to wait for him to come to inquire where exactly was he getting the error. After some while Brian and Julie also joined. We figured ABC was causing lockouts in Prod and was probably the reason was NATCRW was going down. Asked Brian to try and debug the program to see where exactly was it going into an infinite loop. Brian had already asked crew to manually close bulletins. As we were not making much progress in debug asked Gaurav to try and look at the job. Finally after trying for close to an hour we finally succeeded in running the job. It seems the bulletin causing the problem was closed manually closed by crew. On looking into past logs we found that the process had a similar problem last year also. The problem in that case was past moves made for a bulletined job. Although the problem data in this case was not identified, we suspect it may be the same problem.

I have reviewed the logs for Wednesday morning. My findings are that the locking occurrences that started approximately 09:46 in the morning. The locking events occurred as follows. 09:46:21 DS2PMSTR NATNCRWA has timed out with NATNAEXE holding OTDBJOBS.OTTSCTRL.X'00000D' 09:46:38 DS1PMSTR NATNOTTR has timed out with NATNAEXE holding OTDBEMPS.OTTSEMPS.X'000042’ 09:48:01 DS3PMSTR NATNNOTR has timed out with NATNAEXE holding OTDBEMPS.OTTSEMPS.X'000042' In summary, it appears that NATNAEXE was the initial holder of the resource on every system.

The data is stored in files in this directory for a short period between the export and import, then the files are deleted, so this directory can get very large, then very small again in a short period of time. There are also log files in this directory that get large over time and need to be purged. Normally, when these log files get very large, is when we see the alerts like the one above. So periodically we manually clean up the logs by nulling them out. To null the logs you can call the LAN desk and give them the server name (topaxdb2p001) and directory name (/bn/app/ccop) and ask them to null out any files that end in .log. Make sure they don't delete the log files, only null them or emply the data that’s in them.",

I have emailed him asking him how he went about outbounding yard group 01. Hopefully he can shed some light on the matter. I ended up purging the 40 trip yard group records where an employee had 2 tickets. Found that all but 6 employees in yard group 1 received a time ticket for the yard group train symbol and a ticket for the yard engine symbol. Contacted Kenny Padillla who outbounded this yard in the early am. He did know of anything he did different when calling the yard this morning. His quote:\"I don't remember doing anything different but kicking them off when ever it went into failure sorry\" I wrote a query that found duplicate tickets where one is the yard symbol and 1 is the engine symbol. I found 40 employees that had both tickets. I got a grant to update OT.TTEY_TRP_TKT and purged the yard group symbol for the 40 employees. The 6 that did not have 2 tickets showed their ticket on the yard group symbol which is not what they are used to nor what it should be. At this point we advised them to tie up on the group symbol ticket. I believe this worked OK. We did not come to any conclusions on why this is happening. I have added to the research issues list on the maintenance spreadsheet.",

She tried fill again, brought up an employee, then NOFL and got an edit \"Cannot perform NOFL on a job with a filled employee\". I wasn't sure how to advise her at this point and she asked if she could VACT the turn and handle the old way they handle paper deadheads. I advised her to do this and email Wendy with her issue. Below is her issue with Wendy's reply. Rebecca, This is in follow-up to our conversation early this morning. Now that I am logged on to the computer and see the screen shots, I do believe this was a user issue. The first screen gives an edit that she is working out of two different mainframe sessions and, as we discussed, you must use the fill option prior to using NOFL. I have also just sent out a list of 20 or so deadheads that have taken place over the past couple of days. This is the first issue I have heard. Also as we discussed, it may be that Barb is expecting that as soon as she uses “NOFL” that the turn will be removed. This is not the case. The turn will not be removed until after the train has been outbound. The reason we did it this way is because we understand that during the process of canvassing, the user will often times back out of the screen without completing the call. Once they back out, everything done with NOFL to that point is undone.

I asked her if it was one, two, three, ten, all finals on the needles desk or is it system wide. She didn't know the answer but was going to call the dispatcher. I told her to have that information for me when I called back from home and to look at Final and TRNHIS for those trains. Final will actually display the dispatcher final and final time if you enter the train symbol and crew station. I called and she gave me two trains. One had been called and the other was on the tasklist. I looked at the final record and compared it to the order record in ot-ttask_list. The date and time jived so I didn't think we were experiencing any issues. Linda then said she saw it on the T tasklist but didn't think it was on the E tasklist. So I switch my view to the E tasklist and it was there also. Then she stated that the dispatcher finaled the train and we were delaying it because we were calling them 1 hour later than requested. Her example was that he ordered the train for 1700 but we show it to call at 1800. Thankfully donavon was still on the property and became involved. The difference was we were calling the train for 1800 Mountain Time and the dispatcher was finaling for 1700 Pacific Time. This is the same time thus we have no errors. When trains work from Needles to Winslow they cross the timezone. Therefore when trains arrive into Needles from the West they are in Pacific Time but when trains depart Needles going East they are converted to Mountain Time. Hence we have no problems but a little embarrasment. And yes timezone is displayed on the tasklist to assist in avoiding this very error.",

I don't know if it pertains to Article 11, but thought you should take a look at. We had called the Help Desk and had Jon paged, but Caller finagled it and got the employee to the correct turn and called out, so did not have to have Jon fix. Here is what happened: JL Schroeder II owned turn NEE5137-01, which was at the AFHT of Barstow at the time that this occurred, with JL Schroeder II protecting the turn. Turn NEE6154-01 was at the HT and became vacant. TSS awarded the job per bid to JL Schroeder II. TSS then removed JL Schroeder II off of the NEE5137 turn at Barstow and placed him on the NEE6154 turn in Needles, leaving the NEE5137 turn showing on the Needles AFHT board at Barstow with no one on it when you looked at the board (Barsca board 59). When you looked at the job (NEE5137) via CCTO or CCJOB, it showed in removed status. Same with the NEE6154 turn, even though when you looked at the board, it was showing JL Schroeder II marked up on the turn at the HT. We went into CCJOB and showed the remove job flag as N for NEE5137 and it placed the turn back to the foot of the HT board (Needca board 30) as well as showing first out at the AFHT. Caller then POS'd JL Schroeder II back to the turn and called him out. When this was done, TSS removed turn NEE5137 from the HT board and AFHT board, showing out on a train. TSS also removed the NEE6154 turn when JL Schroeder II was removed from the turn. Why would TSS move an employee off of a turn at the AFHT when being awarded a bid? Weird handling, but we did manage to temporarily get this fixed"

The event date and time should have been retreived from the active board record for the shadowed job. OT.TPPRDH_JOB_DTL showed the paper dh job was WIN 3301, and the shadowed job WIN3348. Determined the event date and time to be 2007-11-06, 09.05.00. Turned on test mode with the idea that I was going to update the event date and time prior to the abend, so the UPDATE could take place. However, I neglected to set a break point prior to the abend spot. The abend occurred again, too late to update the event date and time, causing a partial commit. Called in the Calvary -- Bishnu. We spent the next hour trying to correct. The jobs, including the paper dh job had been returned, but the train not canceled. Using Zap 68, Set the Paper DH Job Stat to CO for paper dh job WIN 3301/ shadow job WIN3348, so the system would ignore the pape Dh association. Set the CRW_ACTV_JOB to OX on the OT.TOTBD_EVT, OT.TOTBD_JOB records for the train. Using CCSORT, sorted the AFHT board NEEDCA 50 so that the Paper DH job, WIN 3301, was in front of the shadowed job, WIN3348. Found the task record in File manager and set the CRW_TASK_ACT back to blank using ZAP 51, restoring the task record on the Task List. Called crew and had them check and outbound. We're not sure what happened, but theorize that the paper DH job was on the active board, but not activated. The OT.TPPRDH_JOB_DTL record showed the active job number, WIN WIEB, a place holder job.

There was one entry in 2003 wherein Brian Hurla resolved the issue. Contacted to Julie to get help as to who can be contacted. She suggested to check with Manas. Manas and Bishnu helped with finding the rule with issue. The online batch process in CCPBMP and ran Perm Bump Exp in test mode and found that rule number 0134 is having issue. This rule was being mapped in Force Assign Agreement Matrix for agreement EAWE for station LPCHI. Called up help desk and contacted crew support. Informed Brenda that rule 0134 is incorrectly mapped and needs to be removed or changed. Brenda told that she will inform this to manager to get it corrected. Updated Julie. By this time the job had abened again for run at 1700. Assumed that rule will be corrected. But the job kept abending couple of more times. Then called up Julie again and updated her with details.

To resolve the situation, Rick Poirier created a batch job (based on the EME project modules) which contained the objects from the compiled source code in file 50 (the backup file). Once Rick ran the batch job, the objects in the job replaced the current objects in production so that new users would not hit the incorrect code. Both programs remained in the buffer pool and the Program with the incorrect code would be flushed once all individuals using it have left or re-entered the program. Therefore, the source code in Prep was still incorrect because it contained the code in File 31 (current source code) and not the code of the correct objects in production. Rick rectified the situation and restored the source code from File 50 (backup file) to the Prep environment. What we learned is that an EME should only be moved on Monday or Tuesday if it is for testing purposes so that it can be looked at properly and possibly backed out before 3pm on Thursday. Also, any EME after Thursday runs unbound until the move on Sunday. When a program is unbound, there is no header information indicating that the DB2 access DBRM (DataBase Request Module) has already been built, so every time the program is hit, the SQL has to request DB2 access for the SQL in that module and it is built every time it is run instead of checking the DB2 catalog for the DB2 access information. When it is static, then it has this access information in the DB2 catalog. When it is dynamic, then it builds the access information every time you hit a module with SQL, which is why the bind process is critical to crew whose programs are constantly run.",

The First step was to obtain the SSN’s for each employee (done by going to CCEMP, obtaining the ID, then going to Zap 22 to get the SSN). We then removed the employees from the incorrect jobs by going to zap 11 (OT-TJOCC_WRK), pulling up the job, and blanking out the SSN. To remove the employee (HR Jones) off the markup board, we went to zap 4 (OT-TEMPL_BRDS_WRK), displayed him by his SSN, and purged the record from the table. We then needed to put the appropriate employees in the correct places, so we went to zap 11, browsed for the first job (WIN2111) and put DG Nelson’s SSN on it, then we browsed for the next job(WIN3157) and put HR Jones’s SSN on it. We needed to put EE Bruner on markup board 2 (which involves creating a new record in zap 4), so we first displayed WINSAZ board 2 in CCTO, pick a guy off of it, found his SSN, and pulled up his record in zap 4. We then did an ‘a’dd after changing the SSN to EE Bruner’s SSN and the event date to today and the rotation code to anything else. We then went to zap 7 (OT-TJOB_BOARD) and pulled up each of the jobs (WIN 2111 and WIN 3157) to make sure they were in AT status. They were not, so we modified the records to reflect AT status.

Turned on test and tried simulation and variables seemed to be passing okay. Tried the SELECT which I thought should be pulling the records and got no hits, same as the program.

Called Jeremy and Beth asked him to also look at the task list which he also seen duplicate records for InterBay to Vancouver, Vancouver to Pasco, Pasco to Sherdon 4. We had to add Desk Id's NWE1, NWE2, MON1 and MON2 and chg hours to 90 witin the CCTASK screen using PF9 to pull up the same records that Jeremy was viewing. 5. Found that each set of duplicate sets contained dates for 03/13 and 03/17 on the task list. Asked Jeremy which record was correct. He stated that the 03/17 records contained the correct order times 6. Beth called the Crew office and talked to Marie and had her verify and purge the duplicated task record  that had a last update date of 03/13/08. 7. Marie purged the Interbay to Vancouver and Vancouver to Pasco records 8. Since we found other duplicated tasks Beth talked to Bishnu and Reggie and Brenda (crew) to find out  what caused this train to be duplicated. 9. Reggie found that the TRN_SCHD_DPT date was different for the duplicated records. The train with the 03/13/08 date contained 03/15/08 TRN_SCHD_DPT date, but when it was updated, the date was modified to 03/17/08. This caused the duplicate records to be on the CCPLAN1 and CCTASK list. 10. Beth called Donavan and he went in and purged the other duplicate CCTASK records for the  E-CECSCM0-84A train.

I received several emails today regarding employees from Longview Switching who weren’t able to tie up their tickets. In summary, workers who are NOT BNSF employees use our QT system to generate tickets and receive compensation from BNSF for their work. The process involves TYE Comp systems adding them in QT, then they are added in TSS, and finally they are added to WIFI. In order to receive their pay, they submit 1D or 1C override tickets, and they are paid on these tickets. The particular employees in question were listed on the System 509 board (viewable in CCTO with station ‘SYSTEM’ and board 509). Today’s issue involved 2 items. The first being one of the individuals in question had a blank SSN (which was solved by contacting RACF support), and the second was due to an unfamiliar screen as a result of a yard trip rate move from this weekend. Below is a short explanation from Lee as to why the confusion occurred for the Longview Switching Company. The problem is with a yard trip rate move. Now, when the employees are putting in a yard override ticket they are being asked to enter their home terminal and board number. These are non-BNSF employees that don't have a valid home terminal and board. As long as they enter any valid home terminal station with a board they can get past the pop up. For them they could enter LONJCT and just board 1 and get past the pop-up. This is only being captured for trip rate purposes and won't affect anything on their ticket since they don't have trip rates. This has been in place for the road for years, but the Longview employees are all yard employees and so weren't effected until now.",

This problem was similar then the one we had in the beginning of the year. In the beginning of the year we run into trouble when the coal counter rolled from 799 to 001.

In pda CTPACALL, I found that EMPL_SSNO is populated as CANVASSIN, which is not a valid SSN so the module CRWNCRST called from CTPNRSTM was not able to find rested date. System picks up employee SSN from OT.TCRW_TRN_LOCK if it is populated. I checked up the job in this lock table and found there are records present for both the train with employee SSN as CANVASSIN. I purged those records from CC_10_10_1 in order to get rid of the natural error. After that crew caller was able to outbound the train successfully. When system canvassing it finds the first employee and update the lock table with employee SSN and start calling. If employee rejects the call, system remove the employee SSN from lock table and put CANVASSIN to indicate that this train is currently canvassing. Then it start filling process to find next eligible employee. When next person found it again update that employee SSN in lock table and start calling. So incase due to any problem system stopped after it put CANVASSIN in lock table and before it find the next employee then the intermediate lock record will be there.

The error was an 1143 in module BMPNDTZO at line 340. So I turned Test mode on and tried to do the bump. It failed on the move edited statement because the date and time parameters were blank. I ran XREFPROG to determine where this module was called from. Unfortunately, it is called from over 70 modules including about 20 bump modules. I tried to recreate this scenario in Devl. That took awhile because of edits. I finally got it looking similar on the CCEMP screen by deleting assignment records in File Manager. I tried it and of course it worked successfully. I decided to turn Debug on to step through the process to determine exactly where it was called from. I found that it was being called from BMPNCEDT. From looking at the code, I could not see why it was erroring. There is a check for if the date is blank to assign the current date and time!!! After analyzing the process more, it attempts to use the markup plan date and time from OT-TEMPL_DAYS_OFF unless it is within 6 hours or past. Then it uses the date and time from the bump screen. After not having any success by 10:00, I decided to come to the office to check the support db. I searched for the program and only found 4 entries. Two were related to batch processes which did not help. One was for a different error. Luckily, there was one that was kind of similar. Harrod logged it in 2004. For his resolution, he found that the employee had 2 CUT movement records for the same date and time. He deleted 1 and it worked. When I looked, I saw that JM Hontz had 2 records for 6/30. I deleted 1 using ZAP 40. That didn't work. So I deleted the other 1. Finally, it worked. I still don't know why!",

It was explained to me that the problem was on the LJK side and they were working to fix their end. At that point my concern was with making dispatchers aware that the feed was down and they needed to communicate taxi info some other way. I didn't know (or didn’t' remember) that the dispatchers were alerted on their screens when the VANS request was unsuccessful. We got a dispatcher on the phone and he described the alerts they got when the VANS message was unsuccessful and they have at least 2 alternate methods of ording taxi's. 1. A web interface and 2. Instant Messaging. Bill wanted to get Julie on the call so he paged her. When Julie got on, I found out that she had been working with Corrine who was working with LJK to get the problem resolved sincer earlier this evening. They had no ETA on the issue. Julie recommended we turn off the feed from our side until the issue was resolved so we would stop throwing errors to the alert mechanisms. I did this through CREWM option 9 option 14. PF5 toggles the interface on and off. Bill Pogeman volunteered to turn the interface back on when the problem was resolved. Below is some additional information on the issue.

At 12midnight, Time Warner corrected the DNS issue to restore communications, for a total impact of 5 hours 15 minutes. BUSINESS IMPACT: Taxi reservations were intermittently received by OAI Central Vans for 2 hours 15 minutes. No Taxi reservations were received by OAI for 3 hours. As a workaround, MCO's at Ft. Worth, San Bernardino, and Kansas City used CAD Instant Messaging, the web, or manually called OAI Central Vans to order taxis. SUMMARY TEXT: On Tuesday, August 26th at 6:45pm, Command Post alerts indicated Taxi Dispatch was receiving timeout errors, which was intermittently affecting Taxi reservations at OAI Central Vans (formerly LJK). Investigation found the problem was on OAI side and was caused by a DNS server issue at Time Warner. At 9::00pm, the destination service failed and no taxi reservations were being received by OAI. At 12midnight, Time Warner corrected the DNS issue to restore communications, for a total impact of 5 hours 15 minutes. Workarounds were in place.

It was causing the autoexecute process to start processing, lock then abend, rolling back its work which resulted in no tasks being executed from the task list. It did appear that there we still some trains still being called, but the system was very slow. They would log as calls not started because the process that picks up the response from the IVRs was also locking with all the other stuff. We believe we are running in to this during the more busy traincall times like when we call the yards. Our first goal was to get the locking to stop. We tried stopping OTCRWTL1 on different boxes, which worked a little but would pick up again once turned back on. This also caused many transactions to back up on OTCRWTL1 which isn't good. We turned off autoexecute and gave the T task list to all the callers. They started autoexecuting the task list records and calling the trains, still using autocall. This stopped the locking on the G and H boxes, but locking continued on the E box (because this is where all the callers are logged on and are executing the tasks). Bill suggested we work load balance out the E system, and have all the callers log off and log on to another system. We did this and the locking seemed to stop for the time. We discussed why autoexecute was locking and we thought possibly that multiple instances of autoexecute were getting kicked off. We decided to make a change to the autoexecute process to kick off on only 1 region on each of the 3 boxes. This will aid in single threading the autoexucute process and lessen the chance of 2 instances running at the same time. We made this change and watched a bid when we turned autoexecute back on. It appeared that with the change, we were still having some problem. We saw 240 errors in NATNAEXE (autoexecute). It appeared to be the same problem as before, The autoexecute process was kicking off, abending and rolling back…we would see tasks on the task list go white like autoexecute was occurring, but then go back to non-reverse video like the call had not started. We reverted our change we made and a little while later, autoexecute started executing normally again, but not sure why. Dennis looked at some db2 traces and other things and saw what appeared to be multiple instances of autoexecute running. We may need to do more commits, or find a better way of single threading the autoexecute process., or both.",

Determined it was in the calling process as the decision making test process still worked and went passed the step it was getting hung up on. We called Belinda back and explained that she could use CCDEC, 4 to determine who the employee was to call. Once they found someone to work the job they could 'HELP' them onto the position.

There is a step just previous that builds a work file of all layoff/markup tasks on the task list that are due for execution. Then step 30 inputs that list and will markup/layoff the employees. However, there is a flag in this job that dictates if the layoff/markups are completed. This flag LAYFB OFF in ot-tcrw_mgmt_cd is currently set to off so this step does no work. The abend was coming because the previous step that creates the extract file for employees that are due to be laid off or marked up could not be found.

A fix is in Acceptance testing. Released = Relieved on ticket so limbo for this trip should've been 0. Used CCACT to verify there was no commingling of an activity. Previous inbound and CCACT showed previous monthly limbo total was 10'. Used ZAP to set  OT.TTEY_EMPL.EMPL_TRIP_TOT_MN = 525, OT.TINBD_JOB.EMPL_TRIP_TOT_MN =525. OT.TINBD_JOB.CUR_LIMBO_MN = 10. OT.TINBD_JOB.TRN_LIMBO_MN = 0 OT.TINBD_JOB.TRN_SVC_MN = 45 LMB record OT.TTEY_EMPL_CAP_SVC..TEY_SEP_SVC_MN = 10 MSV record was correct Ran CCEMP was okay. Ran CCINFO and it abended in program INFNBH05. Before it was INFNBH06. Used File manager and found employee had oubound again on an outgoing DH at 0430. Program picked up bad limbo values before I got them fixed. Used ZAP to set OT.TOTBD_JOB.CUR_LIMBO_MN = 10 CCEMP and CCINFO now ran correctly.",

However it was still abending since both employees were involved in previous such issues and those outbound records needed to be corrected. The main issue was that on the deadhead train, off duty date and time picked up was of a previous month train with same day and train symbol.

She was getting error when trying to outbound train X KALCVN9 25 A Error was coming in program CTPNCC08 at line 7730 where it was trying to assign following MOVE EDITED #DOL-TM(#EMPL-COUNT) TO #FRA-TM-T(EM=HHII) with error 1143 i.e. invalid time value. So I tried to run in test mode. I set up a break point at this line and tried to run outbound. I found that it was trying to put value of 0461 in time field which is why it was abending. I got the same abend as I did not correct it at that point. However in the process some of the commits had happened and even though task was still showing up in task list, train was showing outbound. I called Shavonne and asked her to cancel the train outbound. I then started checking again and before that checked the code in CTPNCC08 to find where this value is getting populated and put couple of more breakpoints. There seems to be some issue in the following code at the botton of this description. First time I just updated for first employee and then continued and it abended again. We again cancled the train and started process again. I updated it for first employee and then for second employee somehow it was not getting this issue, so I continued and it commited the data. However, now task was not showing up and also when checked in CCTRNBRO, train was not showing up either. Shavonne was not able to figure what would have happened. Then I checked the tasklist in filemanager and found the task. Got the timestamp and using that went into ZAP 51 and brought up the task and updated the TskAct field to blank, so that the task showed up again. During this we realized that task was not pink and after a while it became pink. So autocall process was also picking up this record while we were trying to outbound in test mode due to which some of the above data issues happened. This time, I tried again and since knowing what to change, quickly changed the values from 0461 to 0501 for both the employees and it was able to outbound successfully. Shavonne verified the details and it looked fine. I informed her that please check if the DOL time values of 0501 are correct.

The rule (Vacancy/Source/Rule) these employees were being called on was Rule #2. However, when we looked at the decision rule there was no Rule #2. I paged Jon Hass & Debasis Mohapatra to a bridge. We looked through the rules. Finally, Rob Neiswender pointed out that when browsing the rule it showed a blank rule 2 & 3 had been mapped. These rules didn't have anything else mapped against them. Since there was no other criteria there were no restrictions stating the employee had to be rested, on a certain occupation, etc. It was wide open. We purged these two rules from the decision. At that point Regina verified that it canvassed the next crews properly. The impact was that several employees rest was disturbed. Since we were already in a canvass situation it further impacted crew supplies. Regina made sure the employees impacted had their time updated to comply with the FRA guidelines. Debasis is running a report to verify if there are any other 'ghost' rules which have been mapped. We will discuss putting some type of edit in which will not allow the user to map this type of rule in the future.",

This is the third occurrence when this job has looped in the last 2 months and consumed a lot of CPU. The issue is that somehow the layoff job ( LOG USER = AUTOLAYF) is creating layoff task in task list with markup date less than the layoff date.

Look in TASK LIST table for these employees where CRW_TASK_TYP = C and CRW_TASK_DESC = LAYF. Check to see if any record for the employee has MARKUP_PLAN_DT/TM less than the CRW_TASK_DT/TM. Modify the record to correct the MARKUP_PLAN_DT/TM Cancel all the jobs hanging in JH and resubmit the job. Alternately, write a query on TASK_LIST to find employees who have MARKUP_PLAN_DT/TM greater than CRW_TASSK_DT/TM and correct the record.

We decided to run it in debug mode to see if we could find anything. We tried to go thru each and every logic. But could only determine that it was looping after going into CRWNMOVE logic. As it was not possible to debug CRWNMOVE logic at that point, checked with Regina again if they can wait before this bump can happen and we can look into this during day time and may run some trace. She was okay with that. During day time, again checked for the employee. But the employee was already showing up marked up on engineer job TUL4125. Checked CCINFO and found that batch process bumped the employee to this job. And system tried notifying employee. First time it was unsuccessful, so system put the employee on LXX and lateron employee accepted notification and got marked up to job. I called up Brenda to check if this is valid.

I started reviewing the program logic to understand the process. Realized that the Timestamp is coming as blank. The timestamp used to restore OT-TCRW_ACTV_JOB details comes from the train outbound details. So I spent some time to locate the outbound details for the train but couldn't find anything for this train for those jobs. I called crew office and learned that these jobs were relief jobs; so they outbounded on N symbol and inbounded with the M train. So their outbound details should be with the N symbol associated with the main train. In the program there is logic to handle relief situation also, it finds out the N symbol and then gets the outbound details of the N symbol to restore the jobs on crew active table. Still I was not sure that why it is not able to locate the correct N symbol outbound details and getting blank timestamp. Later after some more digging I found that there are couple of more records into the table OT-TCRW_RLF with the same N symbol which are old. Those are the records causing the system to mislead and as a result it is not able to find the correct outbound records. So then I knew what to do, I updated those old N symbol records which a different train priority so that system will neglect them expect the correct one.

This is a program converts date/ time into different time zone, so it is called from thousands of programs. The first challenge was to find out the program from where the event date/ time is supplied to this program. After looking into error log it helped me to realized that CCBID simulation of the position also is giving the same error. I knew that simulation process does not update anything in the database so it is safe to turn on the test mode and if I try to simulate the vacancy then I will be able to get the program flow to BNPNDTZ0. In test mode I found the program flow using command OBJCHAIN. Now the event date/ time is not generated in the program calling BMPNDTZ0, it is generated some where before couple of other programs. So I set break points in many programs I found from OBJCHAIN to pin point the program where it is generated. After multiple try, I located the program BMPNFEJD which fetches current and previous assignment related details from OT-TCRW_MVMT_EVT/ HST table. There in this program because of unique earlier movements of the employee, control is going to a specific logical block where I think there is a problem with the logic (subroutine GET-PREV-WRK-SVC-CD) which is making the event date/ time blank. Now I found from where it is coming but I could not understand why. I spent some time to understand the logic to find why it is doing something like this but I realized that without analyzing all other related programs it will be difficult to say what it is trying to do. So I finally started looking for a way to get passed by that block of logic and found that only way is by deleting a previous movement record of the employee. I deleted the movement history of the employee from ZAP and then it worked fine. I called crew office and informed them about the movement that I had to delete in order to make it working.",

I manually went through all the yards jobs (as displayed in CCYDDSP for first shift on Saturday at northtown) using zao 7 and and all the employees on those yard jobs (ZAP 22) and set their status to HT.

When I checked the OT-TOTBD_JOB records for this train (ZAP 15), MW Cooper's off duty date and time were blank. So this upset the cancel process which finds the records in OT-TOTBD_JOB to make the cancel. It can't handle a blank off duty date and time. I put some data in those fields using zap 15 and was able to do the cancel. Kevin then outbounded with the correct employee CL Harris.

After reading Maheedhar's explanation I undestood that an employee had been processed 2 times in the same batch job because during the run of the batch, the employee had been moved from a job in one station to a job in another station, so the batch processed him at the first station, then processed him again at the second station which caused a duplicate log record. I checked JH (job history) on this job to see the error and the last station processed, so I know it had to be an employee processed at WICFALLS. Todd had dealt an error like this in the past and advised me to look at all movements at WICFALLS using CCINFO around the time that the batch abended, then for anyone who had moved from some other station into wicfalls, they were a candidate for the error. I took those candidates and searched the batch job output in JH. If they showed up 2 times, then they were probably the culprit. All I had to do to fix this is resubmit the batch job because the timing issue would most likely not happen again. I think we are more susceptable for this to happen on Monday mornings because of the vast number of employee movements that occur at that time.",

But around that time, the transaction NATTEY abended again. So issue was something else. Rick joined the bridge. We again checked for the issue with NATURAL Admin. Pat McCoy ran traces in prod and found that one particular query in program which is used in CCSEN (seniority roster) was taking lot of CPU and was causing the U240 timeout abends and after 3 abends, transaction was getting locked. Bishnu concurred that he had encountered the issue in Trial couple of weeks back and it was after new Natural version was implemented. Now, new Natural version was implemented on E box.

I made this change, but the job jcl erred because that pushed it over the 2 gig limit. To find out how much space was needed, ran just the step creating the temproary dataset as my own job, changing it to a test dataset. The dataset was created witgh 64 cylinders and 1 extent. (630,975 records) I changed the proc to use SPACE=(CYL,(120,24),RLSE), and remove the avgrec parameter. I had the abended job force complete and the job resubmitted.

He didn’t know if it was happening to anyone else, or not. He said the person he relieved didn’t say anything about this happening as a problem. He will mention it to his relief when the shift changes in a few minutes. Since this appears to only be happening to him (I have not heard anything else, either), and since the messages coming back are different, and does not appear like any I have seen within the Natural programs, I am wondering if it might be some type of communication problem between the mainframe and his machine. Since he was so close to the end of the shift, he was hesitant to reboot. He stopped communications (I think that is what he did) on an emulator and tried to reconnect, but it wouldn’t let him. So after we hung up he was going to do a complete shutdown and reboot. I asked him to ask his replacement that if he or she has similar problems, to make screen prints of the path they are following to do the outbound, as well as the returned messages. Also, to see if this was happening to anyone else. In my opinion, if this is happening to multiple people, then it would bear further investigation by us (crew).

When looking at the records in CCTRNBRO for the outbound at Klamouth Falls and also looking at CCINFO for these employees, they had been outbounded on a N Helper train out of Klamouth Falls then transferred to the H symbol later. Since the two employees showed in the computer as inbounded at Keddie when they had physically inbounded it Klamouth Falls, they were trying to cancel the inbound at Keddie so they could adjust the route on the H symbol to inbound them at Klamouth falls. However when they tried to cancel the inbound of the H train, they got a -180 error. I first tried to use the debugger and set a break point just prior to the error (error program and line showed in natural error log). I found all the time fields and any fields that showed invalid data and set them all to some kind of proper data. When typing \"Go\" in the debugger, it still errored with the -180, but I believe it committed the other records for the cancel. So at this point the H train showed cancelled in cctrnbro, but still did not show up again in CCTRNINB. So to get it back on CCTRNINB I created a zap 2 record for the turn and train (I copied a record for another inbounding train at keddie and tweaked it a little). When trying to re-inbound this train, we got some other edits that would not allow inbound (don't remember fully at this time what the edit said) At this point it seemed such a tangled mess with several different trains all criss crossed in the tables that I just asked Sam at the crew office what end result did he need. He needed Geraud and Nelson at their home terminal at Klamouth Falls with their proper hours of service. I used zap 22 to update their off duty times, their total trip minutes (TotTripMn), their total hours on duty (Duty Tot Hr and Add Mins). Sam had given me these times.

I checked the IMS log later and saw deadlocks and timeouts with the NATNAEXE transaction. I believe the problems were due to this. I completed the following checklist to go through when getting the autoexecute alert. If the Autoexecute alert pops up on the task list: 1. Crew office can begin manually executing trains on the task list in hopes of finding a train that is causing an issue. 2. Check zap 36 Appl Cd “AEXE” Appl Cd Val “SUCC” a.\tAppl Cd Desc will give the last time that the autoexecute process ended successfully 3.\tCheck CCLOG Program AOCERROR and current date/time a.\tShows any natural errors that occurred during the autoexecute process. However if there are error records here, it tells us that it put the train into exception status and moved on to the next trains. So its safe to say that none of these errors were the cause of our issue today. 4.\tCheck CCLOG Program CTPPCIVR a.\tShows trains that got a “AOC Call/s Not Started” and “AOC No Reponse fm IVR”. If these are being logged, then our process is still alive, just created a task exception, so not the problem we had today. 5. The spool file may have data related to the autoexecute abends. (not recommended for users but TS on call support can look) a.\tTo look at the most recent data logged to the spool: b.\tFrom TSO type SPF <enter>, then 3.4 <enter> c.\tType in IMSVS.PROD.*.SPOOL* -or- DEVL, TRIAL, TRAIN in place of PROD d.\tTo look at archive spooler data e.\tFrom TSO SPF f.\tType in JH for job history and choose option J g.\tEnter job name NATNCPTP and a starting date. h.\t(f)ind CTPPEXEC 6.\tThe IMS system log can be checked for system abends, timeouts, etc. I don’t recommend this for a user, but a TS support person can check this. Below are instructions: a.\tReading the IMS system log: b.\tLogon to TSOG (“L TSOG) c.\tGo to IOF (type “TSO I” from ISPF command line d.\tType “/ST SYSLOG” browse the file for the corresponding system (E, G, H) e.\t(F)ind the transaction that is having issues (like NATNAEXE for autoexecute) f.\tAlso search for “NATNAEXE 000,0240” for IMS timeouts (where NATNAEXE is the transaction that is having trouble) g.\t***If it is the next calendar day, find the archived syslog file in “ZM.PROD.H.SYSLOG” where H is the MF box. Debasis and I were discussing this and we decided that the abend of the autoexecute process in these situations may or may not be due to a specific train on the task list. The Autoexecute process is not abending with a natural or DB2 error, but with some IMS system error like a timeout. (option 5 above may find this issue) If we are having system problems like we were today, it is very likely that Autoexecut is abending due to the system problems. In this case, we are in the hands of the technicians. Our best bet is to begin executing trains on the task list manually.",

But then, there were few more trains which had similar multiple future train schedules and users asked if we could remove the future trains from the active train list as the past trains were taking the inventory of the future trains. We asked Bishnu, to look into the issue as we were not sure if the TRNPROF Xpress issue can be handled from offshore as we do not have any access to the PROD Xpress links. Bishnu discussed the issue with the MCO who raised the issue and confirmed that, the above scenario is very unique and is happening because these trains have very long schedules and the past trains with on duty at 02/06/14 are still running and also in the meantime the future schedules are getting created which is creating the conflicts. Also, since the request mainly involves the schedule tables and screens, we cannot help much from our end and they can raise the request to the scheduling team. But the users confirmed that they have got some work around to deal with these issues, either by purging the future active schedules or through dog catch for now and hence the issue can be closed.
